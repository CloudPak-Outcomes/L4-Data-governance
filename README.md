## **PoX best practices** (4-6 hours)<br/>
### 1. **General PoX best practices** :white_check_mark:<br/>
- [General PoX best practices level 4 (YourLearning - 2 hours)](https://yourlearning.ibm.com/activity/PLAN-331A2AB52C0F)

### 2. **[Product-specific best practices](SpecificBestPractices.md)**<br/>
Product-specific framework for scoping and executing successful PoXs. Topics to include:
- Competitive considerations (/CI deck)
    - [Seismic: Data Science and MLOps and AI Governance Competitive (Apr 25, 2023)](https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DCmRVFDWFB4c28T24FXXDMpVH4pG)<br/>
    :scream: Includes 143 slides. Probably not what we want! :scream:<br>
- Environment deployment options for a PoX :interrobang:
> Similar to general one with specific of techzone, CPDaaS, install yourself (only if needed on client resources - hardware)<br/>
> Getting openscale to run on any env.<br/>
> --> Environment provisioning

- Resources to help plan and execute a PoX :interrobang:
> Talk to tech sales<br/>
> Nothing from Elena, maybe Carlo Appugliese
>
- Workshop guidance and materials
    - CPDaaS: Data fabric demos (repackage labs - pdf of md files?)
    - CPD: Analytics modernization workshop :interrobang:Where is it?:interrobang:
> Contact Dirk to find out where it is - and what needs to be done with it
- Product-specific lessons learned
> Nothing from Elena, maybe Carlo Appugliese
